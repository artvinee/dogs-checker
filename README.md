# Dogs checker
It is based on software from https://github.com/Axcent-ape, so it is fully compatible with its sessions (copy all files from sessions to sessions of my software).

In config.py we write necessary delays and referral code (it is better to keep mine).

# IMPORTANT:
(!) All tg accounts need installed username, otherwise the bot just won't let you in and the software will throw errors.
