# Dogs soft by artvine.
It is based on software from https://github.com/Axcent-ape, so it is fully compatible with its sessions (copy all files from sessions to sessions of my software).

In config.py we write necessary delays and referral code (it is better to keep mine).

UPD 23.07
Can now collect a stat table every day (collect daily reward)

UPD 25.07
Can now do tasks

UPD 28.07
Improved the system of task completion, added task execution on refs (when reaching 5 of them), emoji in nickname and others.

In config.py there is an option to choose: remove emoji after completing tasks, or leave.
There is also a black list of tasks, which will be supplemented.

I also added more information to the statistics table. Namely checking for the presence of a connected wallet (True / False), as well as the number of refs on the account.

# IMPORTANT:
(!) All tg accounts need installed username, otherwise the bot just won't let you in and the software will throw errors.
